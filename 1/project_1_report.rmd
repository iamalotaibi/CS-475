# Tell what machine you ran this on
I am running on my PC:

* CPU: **i5-4690K CPU**
* Operating System: **Arch Linux**
* GPU: **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760**

To compile program, run *./runPro* and the output of the program would be in *output.txt*.

I have made the **number of tries** to be fixed at **100**.

*output.txt*:

```{bash echo=FALSE}
cat output.txt
```

# What do you think the actual volume is?
kkk

# Show the performances you achieved in tables and graphs as a function of NUMNODES and NUMT
kkk

# What patterns are you seeing in the speeds?

# Why do you think it is behaving this way?
kkk

# What is the Parallel Fraction for this application, using the Inverse Amdahl equation?
kkk

# Given that Parallel Fraction, what is the maximum speed-up you could ever get?
kkk
